# Adaptive Cell-Based Stability

This repository contains the reference implementation for the experiments reported in:

**Stabilizing Neighborhood-Based Inference via Adaptive Cell-Based Spherical Representation**

The code is provided to support reproducibility of the experimental results presented in the paper.

## Contents

- Point-based neighborhood baselines
- Cell-based spherical representations
- Adaptive cell refinement experiments
- Stability and accuracy evaluation under perturbations

## Dataset

Experiments are conducted using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset is not included in this repository and must be obtained separately.

## Usage

Each experiment script can be executed independently after placing the dataset file (`data.csv`) in the project directory.

## License

This repository is released for academic and research use.
